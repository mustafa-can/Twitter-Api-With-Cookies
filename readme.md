Twitter API is used to get some information (twits, users etc.) from Twitter.
This application is for;
    - getting last ten twits from the user that is searched.
    - making a follow list by cookies.

The application is created by the steps:
    - Registering the the application to the twitter developers page.
    - Get the bearer information by auth.php file.
    - Use the api by gather.php with bearer information to store information to the twitter_cache file and extract information from json.
